    <h2>💫 Becoming the Woman I Needed</h2>
    <p>
      I looked at the girl I used to be — scared, soft-spoken, always trying to be enough.<br><br>
      And I whispered: “You made it.”<br><br>

      I became the woman I needed. The one who sets boundaries with love. The one who speaks up. The one who forgives her past and builds her future.<br><br>

      Healing didn’t come fast. It came in moments — choosing me, over and over again.  
      It came in tears, in joy, in faith.<br><br>

      If you’re still becoming, I see you. Keep going. She’s waiting for you.  
      And when you meet her, hug her tight. Because she is you — free, fearless, and finally home.
