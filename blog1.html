    <h2>🌿 Rising from the Mud</h2>
    <p>
      There are moments in life when everything feels like it's sinking — like the ground beneath you is mud instead of stone.
      <br><br>
      I’ve lived those moments. I’ve cried in silence, smiled while breaking, and carried pain that didn’t have words.
      <br><br>
      But through it all, something inside me refused to stay buried. Faith. Grit. Purpose.
      <br><br>
      This post is for the woman still standing in the mud — feeling stuck, unsure, unseen. I want to tell you: You are becoming. 🌱
      <br><br>
      You are not buried. You are planted.
    </p>
