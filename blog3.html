    <h2>🙏🏾 When God Was Silent</h2>
    <p>
      There were nights I cried and heard nothing.  
      Days I prayed and still — silence.  
      I questioned my worth, my purpose, even my prayers.<br><br>

      But in that silence, something deeper was happening.  
      God wasn’t ignoring me — He was growing me.  
      Teaching me to trust without proof, to walk by faith and not by sight.<br><br>

      Now I see: silence wasn’t punishment.  
      It was preparation.  
      For strength, for wisdom, for purpose I didn’t even know I needed.<br><br>

      So if God feels silent right now — hold on.  
      You’re not forgotten.  
      You’re being formed.  
    </p>
