    <h2>❤ Some Days, I Don’t Feel Strong</h2>
    <p>
      Some days, I feel tired of being the strong one.  
      I want to cry without explaining, to rest without guilt, to just be.  
      I want someone to say, "You don’t have to carry it all today."<br><br>

      Real life isn’t always brave. Sometimes it’s silent breakdowns in the shower,  
      or smiling through heaviness because others depend on you.<br><br>

      But even in those moments — when I feel weak, unsure, messy —  
      I’m still worthy. I’m still growing. I’m still me.<br><br>

      This is your reminder: strength isn’t about never falling.  
      It’s about getting back up, even if you're crawling.
